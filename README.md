## **Overview of Project**

  The overview of the project was to take an original code we have written and edit it in order to have it run faster. Refactoring allows for a smoother read, less code, less bugs, less memory, and more. Now, Steve wants to instead study the entire stock market over a few years rather than solely study this  data set of the stock market. We have refactored code for the 2017 and 2018 stockmarket and highlighted the stocks worth investing green, and the stocks not worth the investment red.
  
## **Results**
    
  The results of the refactored code running through the data set was significantly faster. The difference was from (original code) running in thousands of seconds to (refactored) running in tenths of a second. This proves that refactored code vs original can allow code to run faster and more efficiently.
