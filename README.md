## **Overview of Project**

  The overview of the project was to take an original code we have written and edit it in order to have it run faster. Refactoring allows for a smoother read, less code, less bugs, less memory, and more. Now, Steve wants to instead study the entire stock market over a few years rather than solely study this  data set of the stock market. We have refactored code for the 2017 and 2018 stockmarket and highlighted the stocks worth investing green, and the stocks not worth the investment red.
  
## **Results**
    
  The results of the refactored code running through the data set was significantly faster. The difference was from (original code) running in thousands of seconds to (refactored) running in tenths of a second. This proves that refactored code vs original can allow code to run faster and more efficiently. Now, we have used conditional formatting, which makes it easier to differentiate worthwhile stocks vs not worthwhile stocks. Also, instead of hard coded years, the user can input the year they would like to study, rather than creating a new module.

## **Summary**
### **Advantages to Refactored Code**
THe advantages to refactoring code allows is being able to fine errors that may not have been findable before, finding ways to make the code more efficient, making it more oganized, and creating faster running code.

### **Disadvantages to Refactored Code**
The disadvantages to refactoring code is the time consumption, there is still room for error and even maybe more, and having too large of a data set to refactor.

### **Pros to Original VBA**
The pros to original code is being able to visualize your code in the way you think, and not creating flawed code so that it can look more organized.

### **Cons to Original VBA**
The cons to original is not making it more organized and easier for the next programmer to read, and longer run times.
